            <div class="faq-row-cont">

                <div class="faq-question ">What is California Proposition 65?<i class="icon-plus"></i><i class="icon-minus"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none">In 1986, California voters approved the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act known as Proposition 65. The purpose of Proposition 65 is to ensure that people are informed about exposure to chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and/or other reproductive harm.</div>

                <div class="faq-question ">What are the requirements of Proposition 65?<i class="icon-plus"></i><i class="icon-minus"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none">Proposition 65 mandates that the Governor of California maintain and publish a list of chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects and/or other reproductive harm. The list, which must be updated annually, includes a wide variety of chemicals that can be found in dyes, solvents, drugs, food-additives, by-products of certain processes, pesticides and tobacco products.<br>
                    <br>
                    A company with ten or more employees that operates within the State of California (or sells products in California) must comply with the requirements of Proposition 65. To comply, businesses are: (1) prohibited from knowingly discharging listed chemicals into sources of drinking water; and (2) required to provide a "clear and reasonable" warning before knowingly and intentionally exposing anyone to a listed chemical.</div>

                <div class="faq-question ">What types of chemicals are on the Proposition 65 list?<i class="icon-plus"></i><i class="icon-minus"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none">The list contains more than 850 chemicals, and must be updated once a year. The list has a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that are known to cause cancer or birth defects or reproductive harm. These chemicals can be used in common manufacturing or construction practices, or may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor vehicle exhaust.</div>

                <div class="faq-question ">What product categories might include chemicals that are covered under this warning?<i class="icon-plus"></i><i class="icon-minus"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none">There are many commonly used items that may contain listed chemicals subject to the State of California's Proposition 65 mandates. Some of the products that may require California Proposition 65 warning labels include:<br>
                    <br>
                    Products made with Fabric, Leather, Vinyl, Foam, Synthetic and Non-woven Material Glassware, Ceramics and Tableware Batteries and/or Products that contain batteries Beauty Products (including first-aid kits and lotions)</div>

                <div class="faq-question last">Where can I find more information about Proposition 65?<i class="icon-plus"></i><i class="icon-minus"></i></div>

                <div class="faq-answer" style="display:none">On the delivery date you choose, a message is sent to the recipient informing them of your gift, with a link to retrieve it online. The link in the email goes to a page showing the eGift Card you created (the design you selected, with your recipient's name and your personalized message), its value and code number.
